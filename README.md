# Monte Carlo and Empirical Methods - Self-Avoiding Walks

This repository contains MATLAB implementations and a report on **Monte Carlo methods** for estimating **self-avoiding walks (SAWs)** in `Z^d`. The project explores different **importance sampling techniques** to estimate the number of self-avoiding walks and applies **sequential importance sampling with resampling (SISR)** to improve estimation accuracy.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
Self-avoiding walks (SAWs) are used in various fields, including **statistical physics, combinatorics, and polymer science**. The primary goal of this project is to **estimate the number of SAWs** of length `n` in `Z^d` using Monte Carlo techniques.

The project is divided into the following **key tasks**:
- **Basic Monte Carlo estimation** using naive importance sampling.
- **Improved importance sampling methods** with self-avoiding constraints.
- **Sequential importance sampling with resampling (SISR)** for more accurate estimations.
- **Statistical analysis** of estimated SAWs.
- **Generalization to higher dimensions (`d = 3, 6, 12, 24`)**.
